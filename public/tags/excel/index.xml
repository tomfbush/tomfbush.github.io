      <description>This is a really simple (i.e. probably even the most basic possible) example of using the built in aggregate() function in R, basically a sumif in R. Given a set of data where column a is the values and column b contains the data by which you wish to group (in this example categorical data with values of a or b):
&amp;gt; data a b 1 0 a 2 0 a 3 1 b 4 2 a 5 2 b 6 2 a 7 3 b 8 4 b 9 7 b The aggregate function as I have used it below takes the following arguments &amp;ndash; data$a is the column we are applying a function to; by = refers to a list of names and references to aggregate things by (in this case just one column, so the list has a single element); finally the function we are using here is the built in sum (but this could be a function of your own making, or a mean, or whatever):</description>

      <description>A lot of the data we use is on a daily basis. This is great for more granular insight and for pacing media spend etc. Sometimes however you want to bundle it all up into nice, weekly buckets (often based on &amp;lsquo;week commencing&amp;rsquo;) so that you can look at how weeks affect the sales pattern over the month, for example. This might be harder to see based on daily data. If you need to calculate the week commencing date in Excel (i.</description>

      <description>This article will look at ways to convert dates to text in Excel; that means converting dates into day names, hours, months and more. This is a really simple thing to do but it has a number of uses. As an aside, when you work with data on a daily basis, these sorts of Excel tips come up quite often, and whilst its easy enough to go and find the answers on Excel forums, I thought I would start putting them down here in one place so that I remember them myself, but also so that any interested readers can look super smart to their colleagues by knowing this stuff in advance if they don&amp;rsquo;t already.</description>

      <description>I recently had a need to unhide multiple sheets in ExcelÂ (maybe you call them tabs). Whoever sent me the original file had decided to spread their data out over so many extra sheets that it would have taken almost literally minutes to unhide them all. Naturally, I wasted even more time looking for a way to automate this process. I found two pretty good ways to unhide multiple Excel tabs.</description>
