      <description>Putting this out there in the hope that it helps someone else who&amp;rsquo;s had issues with this mouse (which is otherwise pretty comfy and good value IMO). I bought it from Tesco (who I think own the Technika brand, but seemingly don&amp;rsquo;t want to support it very well). It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t install cleanly in Vista, claiming at the end of the driver install process that the device was unknown. From what I gather this is a general VistaÂ USB mouse issue, but this was where I found the solution for my own problem: http://channel9.</description>
