      <description>What is Wordle? Wordle is a popular online tool that allows you to input a web page, block of text or list of keywords, and have it spit out a graphic known as a word cloud. Wordle does this job pretty well, but something that gets asked at work quite a lot is if there are any Wordle alternatives out there. In addition, Wordle is a little awkward if all you want is an image file at the end of it that you can paste into a presentation for example, without taking screenshots.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a tool to strip HTML tags online, perhaps the one at zubrag.com can help. Bit of background: I update a website every week or so with a post based on a newsletter that comes in DOC format. I convert it to HTML to extract the images easily (they&amp;rsquo;re saved in a directory), then I upload them to Wordpress. What I&amp;rsquo;m left with is a bit horrible because Word does not clean up HTML before it renders it.</description>
