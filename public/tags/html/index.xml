      <description>Beginning with HTML Over the past few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a few people have been asking me if I had any tips for the best HTML beginner resources. This is something that comes up for myself once in while when needing some bit of HTML reference that I have forgotten through under-use. In order to kill two (three?) birds with one stone I thought I would make a list for myself&amp;ndash;in the form of a post&amp;ndash;that I could share with those people.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a tool to strip HTML tags online, perhaps the one at zubrag.com can help. Bit of background: I update a website every week or so with a post based on a newsletter that comes in DOC format. I convert it to HTML to extract the images easily (they&amp;rsquo;re saved in a directory), then I upload them to Wordpress. What I&amp;rsquo;m left with is a bit horrible because Word does not clean up HTML before it renders it.</description>
