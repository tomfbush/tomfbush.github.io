      <description>I just loaded up bbLean as a way of speeding up my old Win7 laptop, only to discover that Google Chrome (the app I use the most) was flickering really badly because it has its own skin, and bbLean was trying to apply its own titlebar too. I would have just commented on Nimret&amp;rsquo;s blog to say thanks, but it seems that comments are turned off. I decided to post thanks and the method here instead (but you can read the original here).</description>
