      <description>Note to self more than anything, this snippet was handy for to remove duplicate rows in SQL, that crept into a Postgres database as a result of a dodgy join.
There are probably more than a couple of ways of doing this but the best example I came up with after reading around is:
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE ctid NOT IN ( SELECT min(ctid) FROM table_name GROUP BY field1, field2); The reason this works revolves around the ctid field.</description>
