      <description>Introduction At this stage, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m going to pass or fail my MPhil. I&amp;rsquo;ve written around 120,000 words in total over the past half a decade, and submitted 60,000 of those prior to my viva. Of those, 30,000 were utter rubbish and needed rewriting. I&amp;rsquo;m going through that rewriting process now &amp;ndash; things are definitely better, but whether they&amp;rsquo;re good enough I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I have learnt how to write a thesis with all the wry wisdom of hindsight, and much self-flagellation.</description>
