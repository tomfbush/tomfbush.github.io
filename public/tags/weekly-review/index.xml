      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of creating an app that helps with a weekly review for a while. I first came across the idea when reading about Getting Things Done and the massive list of &amp;lsquo;triggers&amp;rsquo; that comes with that. To be honest I found it a bit daunting and didn&amp;rsquo;t need to check all those things every week. So, in my own simple, trivial way I&amp;rsquo;ve written what is essentially just a web page with a list on it, except that the list updates a progress bar and nicely removes things from focus when they are complete.</description>
