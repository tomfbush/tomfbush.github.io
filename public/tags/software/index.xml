      <description>I just loaded up bbLean as a way of speeding up my old Win7 laptop, only to discover that Google Chrome (the app I use the most) was flickering really badly because it has its own skin, and bbLean was trying to apply its own titlebar too. I would have just commented on Nimret&amp;rsquo;s blog to say thanks, but it seems that comments are turned off. I decided to post thanks and the method here instead (but you can read the original here).</description>

      <title>Convert dates to text in Excel: days, months, times and more</title>

      <description>This article will look at ways to convert dates to text in Excel; that means converting dates into day names, hours, months and more. This is a really simple thing to do but it has a number of uses. As an aside, when you work with data on a daily basis, these sorts of Excel tips come up quite often, and whilst its easy enough to go and find the answers on Excel forums, I thought I would start putting them down here in one place so that I remember them myself, but also so that any interested readers can look super smart to their colleagues by knowing this stuff in advance if they don&amp;rsquo;t already.</description>

      <description>I recently had a need to unhide multiple sheets in ExcelÂ (maybe you call them tabs). Whoever sent me the original file had decided to spread their data out over so many extra sheets that it would have taken almost literally minutes to unhide them all. Naturally, I wasted even more time looking for a way to automate this process. I found two pretty good ways to unhide multiple Excel tabs.</description>

      <title>Paste as Plain Text In Any App With Puretext, A Free Portable Windows App</title>

      <description>There are a number of situations that you might want to paste as plain text, i.e. with all formatting removed.
 Lots of copy and pasting from the web results in formatted text. This is fine if you are only pasting into a search box, URL bar or Notepad, but if you are putting this into Evernote, Word, Powerpoint or other rich text aware applications, you don&amp;rsquo;t always want to keep the source formatting.</description>

Ha ha ha. Without realising it, I&amp;rsquo;ve been repeatedly shutting down to install the same Windows Updates on Vista for the past 2 weeks.</description>

      <description>Finally, after months of waiting and an endless stream of complaints from users all over the world, Spotify have updated their Android app and fixed the issues with crashing open opening, crashing when syncing and crashing a few seconds into playing. All these, as you&amp;rsquo;d expect, lead to a pretty poor experience and one that left me feeling a bit ripped off. However, the latest update has a revamped UI that fits nicely with ICS, includes extra features and also DOESN&amp;rsquo;T CRASH.</description>

      <description>This is a problem I&amp;rsquo;ve only ever had on Windows 7 but I gather it can affect you on XP too. If Evernote says
 Synchronization failed, could not connect to Evernote server
 and you aren&amp;rsquo;t sure why because everything else seems to work on the internet, go to Tools menu, Options, then the General tab and then click on &amp;ldquo;Log folder&amp;rdquo;. If in recent logs you can see</description>
