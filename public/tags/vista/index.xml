      <description>[caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_250&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;alignright&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;199&amp;rdquo;] If Windows Update Failed One More Time My Laptop Would Look Like This (I Don&amp;rsquo;t Know Who That Girl Is Though)[/caption] There was me thinking that the Windows Update mechanism was designed to streamline updates to the operating system, eliminating the need to go to a website to download fixes and patches. Ha ha ha. Without realising it, I&amp;rsquo;ve been repeatedly shutting down to install the same Windows Updates on Vista for the past 2 weeks.</description>

      <description>Putting this out there in the hope that it helps someone else who&amp;rsquo;s had issues with this mouse (which is otherwise pretty comfy and good value IMO). I bought it from Tesco (who I think own the Technika brand, but seemingly don&amp;rsquo;t want to support it very well). It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t install cleanly in Vista, claiming at the end of the driver install process that the device was unknown. From what I gather this is a general VistaÂ USB mouse issue, but this was where I found the solution for my own problem: http://channel9.</description>
