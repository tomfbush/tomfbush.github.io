<p>Wordle is a popular online tool that allows you to input a web page, block of text or list of keywords, and have it spit out a graphic known as a word cloud. Wordle does this job pretty well, but something that gets asked at work quite a lot is if there are any Wordle alternatives out there. In addition, Wordle is a little awkward if all you want is an image file at the end of it that you can paste into a presentation for example, without taking screenshots. Here&rsquo;s a list of a few sites that do a similar job (being sites they are of course compatible with Windows and Mac) and a few other alternatives to Wordle that you might want to consider. Here&rsquo;s an example of a Wordle word cloud for comparison with the alternatives listed below: <a href="http://www.tombush.co.uk/online-tools-2/4-wordle-alternatives/attachment/wordle-alternatives/"><img src="http://www.tombush.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/wordle-alternatives-300x165.png" alt="wordle alternatives"></a></p>
<h2 id="wordle-alternative-1-abcya-word-clouds-for-kids">Wordle Alternative #1: ABCya! Word Clouds for Kids</h2>
<p><img src="http://www.tombush.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/abcya-300x195.jpg" alt="ABCya! Wordle alternative"> ABCya! Word Clouds is pretty basic, but it can be forgiven since it&rsquo;s aimed at kids. It also has a handy randomise feature, so if you need a quick result, this is a great choice. It accepts a body of text as its input. It also allows you to quickly adjust the number of words that contribute to the word cloud, which is also handy and allows you to eliminate truly infrequent words (the aim of the word cloud is to illustrate quickly what is popular rather than give the whole picture). It occasionally seems to place a word too far out, and the random colour schemes can be garish at times, but that&rsquo;s the whole point of random and it might be what you want! Head over to <a href="http://www.abcya.com/word_clouds.htm">http://www.abcya.com/word_clouds.htm</a> to check it out. It relies on Flash which may be a pain point for some.</p>
<h2 id="wordle-alternative-2-tagxedo">Wordle Alternative #2: Tagxedo</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.tombush.co.uk/online-tools-2/4-wordle-alternatives/attachment/tagxedo-wordle-alternative/"><img src="http://www.tombush.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tagxedo-wordle-alternative-300x286.jpg" alt="tagxedo wordle alternative"></a> Second up is Tagxedo. Tagxedo has way more options as it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;dumbed down&rsquo; for children, so straight away you can use it to make a word cloud out of your blog, tweets, other RSS feed and more. It also allows great control over the shape of the cloud including using words and graphics. As you can see above, I have chosen to create my word cloud in the shape of a rubber duck. Something that wasn&rsquo;t immediatiely obvious is that you have to let it load a preset word cloud and then click on &ldquo;Load&rdquo; to be able to add your own text for transformation. A great feature of Tagxedo is that you can add a list of keywords of the form keyword:frequency (e.g. rubberducky:7) and it will act as if the word has been used that many times. For people with PPC or other quantified data (e.g. a keyword list from Adwords with impressions or clicks) it&rsquo;s only a few concatenations away from providing a nice quick way to represent keyword themes to a client. Tagxedo can be found at <a href="http://www.tagxedo.com/">http://www.tagxedo.com/</a> and is built on Silverlight.</p>
<h2 id="wordle-alternative-3-worditout">Wordle Alternative #3: WordItOut</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.tombush.co.uk/online-tools-2/4-wordle-alternatives/attachment/worditout-wordle-alternative/"><img src="http://www.tombush.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/WordItOut-wordle-alternative-288x300.png" alt="WordItOut wordle alternative"></a> WordItOut requires you to submit your email address before you can easily download your word cloud (although you could just screengrab it). This is a big turn-off, but its reason for asking is apparently so that you can share the tag cloud and edit it again in the future, amongst other things. This seems fair enough. The site is ad-supported which I would hope means they aren&rsquo;t selling the email addresses on! It&rsquo;s neither here nor there in terms of features, sort of not as advanced as Tagxedo but cleverer than ABCya!. On the other hand it has a nice summary of all the word clouds that have been created by the community, which may be inspirational or a bit too sharey for you, but it&rsquo;s interesting either way. Also it appears to be written without Flash or Silverlight which is nice if you&rsquo;re on an unsupported device or OS (but could explain the slightly less &lsquo;tidy&rsquo; arrangement of words). Link to Word It Out: <a href="http://worditout.com/">http://worditout.com/</a></p>
<h2 id="wordle-alternative-4-tagul">Wordle Alternative #4: Tagul</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.tombush.co.uk/online-tools-2/4-wordle-alternatives/attachment/tagul-wordle-alternative-2/"><img src="http://www.tombush.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tagul-wordle-alternative1-298x300.png" alt="tagul wordle alternative"></a> Tagul requires a full sign up before you can get cracking. It&rsquo;s worth it though, because like WordItOut it means you can keep working on a tag cloud in case it&rsquo;s not right first time. This is handy because Tagul has a decent number of features. You will want to filter common words which isn&rsquo;t a feature as standard (the other Wordle alternatives reviewed here seem to do it by default). One cool feature is that you can embed your cloud with a default link for each individual tag, for example to click through to a Google search for the tag text itself. Visit <a href="http://tagul.com/">http://tagul.com/</a> for more, it uses Flash.</p>
<h2 id="other-alternatives-to-wordle">Other alternatives to Wordle</h2>
<p>There is an interesting approach to getting a more dynamic Wordle cloud out of Excel <a href="http://www.clearlyandsimply.com/clearly_and_simply/2010/11/wordle-tag-clouds-in-microsoft-excel.html">here</a>. Whilst this isn&rsquo;t strictly a Wordle alternative, if your reason for seeking one was avoiding the process rather than the end result of Wordle, then this may help. There are a whole bunch of Javascript tutorials that probably go beyond the scope of those who simply want to create a word cloud&hellip; maybe I&rsquo;ll save those for another day. In the meantime if your aim is to get a static, non-Flash or Silverlight word cloud out of some data, there is an easy to understand example at <a href="http://www.lucaongaro.eu/demos/jqcloud/">http://www.lucaongaro.eu/demos/jqcloud/</a> &ndash; just check out the source of the page and you&rsquo;ll see that you need to have word frequency calculated in advance.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<h2 id="there-are-plenty-of-other-types-of-visualisation-out-there-to-be-used-but-word-clouds-are-simple-to-read-and-a-great-way-to-illustrate-the-prominence-of-themes-within-a-text-or-body-of-work-if-you-have-found-any-other-wordle-alternatives-then-please-let-me-know-in-the-comments-and-ill-add-them-to-this-list--">There are plenty of other types of visualisation out there to be used, but word clouds are simple to read and a great way to illustrate the prominence of themes within a text or body of work.

<p><a href="http://www.tjtaylor.net/faqs" title="alextjtaylor@hotmail.com">TJ Taylor</a> - <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jan 5, 2013<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Thanks Tom, this was exactly what I looking for. I had the same frustrations with trying to save the final image with Wordle, and I found Tagxedo to be fantastic. Lots of options (too many - I spent almost an hour fiddling with them all, fun though!) and easy to use interface. The only downsides to Tagxedo in my opinion is that it&rsquo;s not so obvious where the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; shape option is, if you don&rsquo;t want your cloud to be duck-shaped, and I haven&rsquo;t found any way to save it, in case I want to come back to it (after investing so much time in it&hellip;). Kudos to the tool&rsquo;s creators though, and if anyone&rsquo;s interested, I&rsquo;ve linked my name on here to the word cloud I created with it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Great! Finally, a simple tool for my techphobic students! Just the first one I tried - abc - will be a good start, and we can look at other alternatives as we go. thanks</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Glad it might be of some use! Feel free to report back if you run into any problems/find anything new!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>this is mint this</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I found Tagxedo to be perfect for my use until I read the TERMS of use. Anything you produce is basically theirs. You will need their permission for example if you were making a T-Shirt in your own business to sell. I see how they can track this by making a copy on their own servers if they decide to sue you for breaking the terms. I prefer to be operating in a legal sense. I am looking for an application where anything I manipulate and create using it such as photoshop, or illustrator, is my property. Back to the drawing board and searching the web for another word cloud app.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Really good point that I totally missed. Tagul has quite a cheap &ldquo;$5 per commercial word cloud&rdquo; policy, which is <em>better</em> but not quite what you seek (which I fully understand). There are plenty of fledgling PHP word cloud scripts out there that do the basics, and a whole lot of CSS tutorials about fitting text into shapes. Looks like that&rsquo;s another project to go on the list! In the meantime if you find anything truly free then please do let me know and I&rsquo;ll make it top of the list!! I don&rsquo;t know Photoshop/Illustrator well at all but are there any plugins there that could help?</p>
