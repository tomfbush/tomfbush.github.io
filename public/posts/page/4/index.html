    [Edited 2020-05-15: Emerge Desktop’s website no longer exists so I linked to an archive.org backup] I’ve been using a Samsung N145 Plus netbook for a while now. Whilst I am happy with it in general, I do find that sometimes it slows down for no apparent reason. Here are a few tips to help speed up your machine that you might not have thought of.
Use the right web browser at the right time I find that Google Chrome starts quickest on the N145 Plus, so I use that if I quickly want to check email or look something up.

    What is Senet? [caption id=&#34;&#34; align=“alignright” width=“240”]Senet game at the British Museum[/caption] Senet (or “senat”) is (or was) an ancient Egyptian board game. It’s a bit like snakes and ladders, and a bit like backgammon. It’s easy to get into and doesn’t have too many rules either.
The Rules of Senet The rules of Senet are not definite – they’ve never been discovered, so the best guess at how the game works comes from scholars who have examined the boards that have been found, the imagery found on them, and how the special squares (depecting stages on the journey to the Egyptian afterlife) might relate to the players&#39; progress.
