    [caption id=“attachment_342” align=“alignright” width=“300”]A delicious Google Insights cake[/caption] Google Cakes? There are loads of them. Look closely and you’ll even find a cake inspired by Google Analytics. But are you ready for the long, lost, long-tail, best Google cake ever? So I was going through Evernote having a clear out, when I noticed this photo of a Google Insights cake that was made for a competition at work. You may know that Google Insights has been absorbed into Google Trends and had a redesign, so this cake is no longer accurate.

</div>
<div class="content">
  
    I’ve been having LOVEFiLM buffering problems for some time now. This only started when we changed broadband provider, so I’m tempted to say that it’s Virgin’s traffic shaping that is causing the issues. Anyway, I’m not writing to moan about that, I don’t know exactly what has caused the problem so I’m not pointing my finger at anyone. When in full screen mode, I get LOVEFiLM constantly buffering every minute or so, for 2-5 seconds.

</div>
<div class="content">
  
    I recently had a need to unhide multiple sheets in Excel (maybe you call them tabs). Whoever sent me the original file had decided to spread their data out over so many extra sheets that it would have taken almost literally minutes to unhide them all. Naturally, I wasted even more time looking for a way to automate this process. I found two pretty good ways to unhide multiple Excel tabs.
