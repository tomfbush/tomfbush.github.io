 Lots of copy and pasting from the web results in formatted text. This is fine if you are only pasting into a search box, URL bar or Notepad, but if you are putting this into Evernote, Word, Powerpoint or other rich text aware applications, you don’t always want to keep the source formatting.

    [caption id=“attachment_298” align=“alignright” width=“300”]Sharing a YouTube video at a specific time; although why you would want to skip any of this song is beyond me.[/caption] Okay, so this is nothing new but I still seem to sit through YouTube videos waiting for the one funny bit I’ve been told about. Imagine all the time that would be saved in the world if people would just right click on the YouTube video and select “Copy Video URL at current time”.

    Why I can’t keep a resolution I make on New Year’s Eve Yes yes, I know it’s a bit early to be posting my New Year’s resolutions for 2013, but every December 31st I decide that I should probably choose to give up something, start doing something, start giving up something or whatever, and I never stick to it because:
 It’s not a realistic goal I’m clearly not that bothered if I don’t want to change it all year round It’s usually something vague that allows me to interpret my own rule to the point that the only thing I achieve is outwitting myself  With these points in mind, I have decided to make a list of multiple easy resolutions that will result in an overall net happiness increase, either because they save me money, remove clutter from my head or my room, or may have some kind of other health impact.
