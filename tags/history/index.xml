[caption id=&amp;quot;&amp;quot; align=&amp;ldquo;alignright&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;240&amp;rdquo;]Senet game at the British Museum[/caption] Senet (or &amp;ldquo;senat&amp;rdquo;) is (or was) an ancient Egyptian board game. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like snakes and ladders, and a bit like backgammon. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to get into and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have too many rules either.
The Rules of Senet The rules of Senet are not definite &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;ve never been discovered, so the best guess at how the game works comes from scholars who have examined the boards that have been found, the imagery found on them, and how the special squares (depecting stages on the journey to the Egyptian afterlife) might relate to the players' progress.</description></item></channel></rss>
