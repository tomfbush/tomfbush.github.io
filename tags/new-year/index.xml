It&amp;rsquo;s not a realistic goal I&amp;rsquo;m clearly not that bothered if I don&amp;rsquo;t want to change it all year round It&amp;rsquo;s usually something vague that allows me to interpret my own rule to the point that the only thing I achieve is outwitting myself With these points in mind, I have decided to make a list of multiple easy resolutions that will result in an overall net happiness increase, either because they save me money, remove clutter from my head or my room, or may have some kind of other health impact.</description></item></channel></rss>
