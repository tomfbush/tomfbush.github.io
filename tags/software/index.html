</div>
<div class=content>
There are a number of situations that you might want to paste as plain text, i.e. with all formatting removed.
Lots of copy and pasting from the web results in formatted text. This is fine if you are only pasting into a search box, URL bar or Notepad, but if you are putting this into Evernote, Word, Powerpoint or other rich text aware applications, you donât always want to keep the source formatting.
