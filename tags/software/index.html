</div>
<div class=content>
There are a number of situations that you might want to paste as plain text, i.e. with all formatting removed.
Lots of copy and pasting from the web results in formatted text. This is fine if you are only pasting into a search box, URL bar or Notepad, but if you are putting this into Evernote, Word, Powerpoint or other rich text aware applications, you don’t always want to keep the source formatting.

Finally, after months of waiting and an endless stream of complaints from users all over the world, Spotify have updated their Android app and fixed the issues with crashing open opening, crashing when syncing and crashing a few seconds into playing. All these, as you’d expect, lead to a pretty poor experience and one that left me feeling a bit ripped off. However, the latest update has a revamped UI that fits nicely with ICS, includes extra features and also DOESN’T CRASH.
