WordPress can’t edit category slug? WordPress wouldn’t allow me to edit the category slug “online-tools-2” down to “online-tools” no matter what I did. Just a quick shout out here to KAVDesign.net who have posted the answer to the problem I was having… thanks guys. The answer in my case was to delete the tag that already had the same slug (which also leads to asking what I should be using tags and categories for, how they should differ).

What is Wordle? Wordle is a popular online tool that allows you to input a web page, block of text or list of keywords, and have it spit out a graphic known as a word cloud. Wordle does this job pretty well, but something that gets asked at work quite a lot is if there are any Wordle alternatives out there. In addition, Wordle is a little awkward if all you want is an image file at the end of it that you can paste into a presentation for example, without taking screenshots.

</div>
<div class=content>
There are a number of situations that you might want to paste as plain text, i.e. with all formatting removed.
Lots of copy and pasting from the web results in formatted text. This is fine if you are only pasting into a search box, URL bar or Notepad, but if you are putting this into Evernote, Word, Powerpoint or other rich text aware applications, you don’t always want to keep the source formatting.

Why I can’t keep a resolution I make on New Year’s Eve Yes yes, I know it’s a bit early to be posting my New Year’s resolutions for 2013, but every December 31st I decide that I should probably choose to give up something, start doing something, start giving up something or whatever, and I never stick to it because:
It’s not a realistic goal I’m clearly not that bothered if I don’t want to change it all year round It’s usually something vague that allows me to interpret my own rule to the point that the only thing I achieve is outwitting myself With these points in mind, I have decided to make a list of multiple easy resolutions that will result in an overall net happiness increase, either because they save me money, remove clutter from my head or my room, or may have some kind of other health impact.

I noticed a few people around the web asking how to convert PDFs into RTF (rich text) files, a more useful, accessible format if you are doing a lot of copying and pasting etc. So I’ve made a really simple Automator app that will create a RTF on your desktop of any PDF you drop onto it (so I also keep that on my desktop, but it might work from the dock too).

Introduction At this stage, I don’t know if I’m going to pass or fail my MPhil. I’ve written around 120,000 words in total over the past half a decade, and submitted 60,000 of those prior to my viva. Of those, 30,000 were utter rubbish and needed rewriting. I’m going through that rewriting process now – things are definitely better, but whether they’re good enough I don’t know, but I have learnt how to write a thesis with all the wry wisdom of hindsight, and much self-flagellation.
