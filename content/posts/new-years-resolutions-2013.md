Why I can't keep a resolution I make on New Year's Eve
------------------------------------------------------

Yes yes, I know it's a bit early to be posting my New Year's resolutions for 2013, but every December 31st I decide that I should probably choose to give up something, start doing something, start giving up something or whatever, and I never stick to it because:

*   It's not a realistic goal
*   I'm clearly not that bothered if I don't want to change it all year round
*   It's usually something vague that allows me to interpret my own rule to the point that the only thing I achieve is outwitting myself

With these points in mind, I have decided to make a list of  multiple easy resolutions that will result in an overall net happiness increase, either because they save me money, remove clutter from my head or my room, or may have some kind of other health impact. These are all things I've been thinking for some time, so I know that they aren't spur of the moment decisions. Ultimately, if I achieve any of these then I will have succeeded in keeping a New Year's resolution for the first time in my nearly 3 decades on the planet... so go ahead, scoff at them and tell me that they don't compare to the way you plan to run 365 marathons in a year, or learn to fly entirely unaided, or eat only Quavers, I don't care.

Tom's New Year's Resolutions 2013
---------------------------------

Here come the resolutions, in no particular order (other than the order in which they are written, one of the problems with language):

1.  Don't buy any more stationery until there is nothing left to write on (and try to use [Evernote](http://www.tombush.co.uk/tag/evernote/ "Evernote articles") in the first place)
2.  Don't buy any more pens or pencils until there is nothing left to write with (see New Year's Resolution #1)
3.  Don't buy any more books until I've read everything I own (and when they've been read, write a short review for myself and take them to the charity shop)
4.  Don't buy any more games for PC, Android, iOS or other until they are completed.
5.  Get rid of an item of clothing every week. I have too much stuff, as you may have gathered from the above resolutions. I wear less than half of the clothes I own, so  I really don't want to be carting it all around with me if I move.
6.  Eat no more than one pizza a month, and make it something other than pepperoni. This isn't a health thing, I'm just concerned that if I overdo pizza, I'll go off it, and I don't want to go off it.
7.  Avoid fast food restaurants. So good, but so bad. Echoes resolution #6. Both also help with money.
8.  Launch a new website. I have a dozen or so projects and ideas, all of which are destined for failure, but are driving me mad to not at least try out.
9.  For every gadget I bring into the house, another has to leave. This will be made easier if my Macbook Air 2011 keeps breaking and spends 2 weeks of every month getting fixed by Apple.
10.  Finish the album that's been in the works for a few years. There are a privileged few who know that I am in a band, and that we actually try to make albums. Since moving to London and finding out [how not to write a thesis](http://www.tombush.co.uk/education/how-to-write-a-thesis/ "How to write a thesis (including how not to write a thesis)"), I've been a terrible band-member and I'm sitting on material that needs to be freed into mediocre song form. That must change.

Ten New Year's resolutions seems like a nice round number. I can see a few problems appearing however. Any nights down the Duke will seriously endanger resolutions #6 and #7. New clothes for Christmas had better be perfect or they are getting sent back if I'm to reduce the number I have. Flash sales on the Android market make it difficult not to buy awesome things for 69p... So there you have it, my mundane list of everyday things that most people wouldn't even consider habits or problems. We spend almost all of our time being mundane, so I've decided to approach the little things first in the hope that if I can save some cash, clear some space and get some balls rolling that have come to a halt, then less mundane things will happen in 2013.
