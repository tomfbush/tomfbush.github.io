WordPress can't edit category slug?
-----------------------------------

WordPress wouldn't allow me to edit the category slug "online-tools-2" down to "online-tools" no matter what I did. Just a quick shout out here to KAVDesign.net who haveÂ [posted the answer to the problem I was having](http://www.kavdesign.net/blog/coding/problem-with-category-slug-renaming-in-wordpress/)... thanks guys. The answer in my case was to **delete the tag that already had the same slug** (which also leads to asking what I should be using tags and categories for, how they should differ).
