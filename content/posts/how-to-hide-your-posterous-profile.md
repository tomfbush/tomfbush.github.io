I'm not claiming this makes your Posterous anonymous at all, but if you would like to hide your profile information from being displayed on your Posterous site/blog/whatever:

1.  Go to "Manage"
2.  Go to "Theme my site"
3.  Click on "Advanced" and name your new template
4.  Expand the editor using the link on the right
5.  Remove everything from and including <sectionÂ id="profile"> up to and including the relevant occurrence of </section>
6.  Repeat for other sections if you want to remove contributor lists etc.

Note: I don't see why a theme would be made this way, but if you were using a theme that had a section inside a section, this might get more complicated. Seek advice if you aren't sure. Then again, Posterous tells you to save a new template anyway so what have you got to lose? Go crazy.
