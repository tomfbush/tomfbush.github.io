This post is a quick one on WinSXS cleanup, and it works (for me). None of the instructions I found online helped me, including the KB2852386 fix on Windows update. Try this:

*   Go toÂ C:\\Windows\\system32
*   Right click on cleanmgr.exe and Run As Administrator
*   Now, the relevant "Windows Update Cleanup" option and another for cleaning up Service Pack backups should appear. Tick them both
*   Proceed!

For me this worked a treat for WinSXS cleanup.
