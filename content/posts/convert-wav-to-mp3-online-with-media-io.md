A few days ago I needed to convert a short wav file to mp3 format. I wanted to email a recording to a few friends, and the wav filecame in around 15mb, so I figured converting to mp3 would be a good idea, to save time and bandwidth (especially since what I was sending was so trivial that quality didn't matter). I didn't want to install any extra software on my work PC (although Audacity is always installed at home!) and found that website [media.io](http://media.io/) did the job nicely. It converts from a surprising number of formats including WMA, MP3, Real Audio, M4A, FLAC, AAC, ASF, OGG, Musepack, and converts to MP3, OGG, WAV and WMA. The maximum file size is a generous 250mb (I presume this refers to the uncompressed or source file). It's easy to use and reasonably fast (although I tested it on a much smaller file than the maximum allowed). Well worth bookmarking in case you find yourself on a friend's/work/new PC and need to convert audio files.

Thanks Tom for the nice review. media.io now has Pro Accounts that give you 500 MB maximum file size -- in case you have something big to convert. Regards
