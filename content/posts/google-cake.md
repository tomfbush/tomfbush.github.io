There are [loads of them](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=google+cake "Google Cakes"). Look closely and you'll even find a cake inspired by Google Analytics. But are you ready for the long, lost, long-tail, best Google cake ever? So I was going through [Evernote](http://www.tombush.co.uk/software/could-not-connect-to-evernote-server-fix/ "“Could not connect to Evernote server” fix") having a clear out, when I noticed this photo of a _Google Insights_ cake that was made for a competition at work. You may know that Google Insights has been absorbed into Google Trends and had a redesign, so this cake is no longer accurate. However, I like to think that this was more than just a quirky cake, it was a historically significant document. Unfortunately, it was also delicious, meaning this photograph, like the cake before it, is just a representation of something that once was. I suppose I could do a whole range of posts of Google-related memorabilia (in fact I already posted my [Android USB keychain](http://www.tombush.co.uk/photography/googles-other-android-usb-keychain/ "Google’s other Android USB Keychain"), yes, I'm very sad). Unfortunately they move so fast these days that they'll probably do anything I think of for real at some point. This would of course negate all the one-off novelty value, and steal the limelight for themselves. I did look into Bing-themed cakes, but it seems [nobody](http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bing+cake "Bing cakes") really wants to turn Bing into a tasty baked treat. That might be because the Bing logo doesn't lend itself so well to the primary colours of shop-bought icing. I'd love to be proved wrong, of course. Send me your photos! Even better, send me your cake!
