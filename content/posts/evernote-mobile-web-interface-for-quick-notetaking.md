\[caption id="attachment\_145" align="alignright" width="214" caption="Evernote Mobile interface could help save time when taking notes"\][![evernote mobile screenshot](http://www.tombush.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/evernote-mobile-267x300.png "evernote mobile")](http://www.tombush.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/evernote-mobile.png)\[/caption\] I've been using Evernote's Mobile web interface ([http://evernote.com/m/](http://evernote.com/m/)) to take notes quickly on desktop PCs. I find the full Evernote interface (desktop client or web) a too distracting if all I want to do is make some plain text notes without reviewing what's already there. (NB: On Ubuntu I found Firefox gave me an XML error when visiting the mobile site, whereas Chrome worked fine. I don't know if this is the same on Windows/other operating systems.)[](http://www.tombush.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/evernote-mobile.png)
