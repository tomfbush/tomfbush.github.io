![Adwords segment by conversion type](http://www.tombush.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/wpid-New_conversion_segments_in_Adwords.png "Adwords segment by conversion type") You can now segment by conversion type in Adwords (now directly as part of the interface anyway). Previously I think these were only available as part of adding segments to a downloaded AdWords report. Not a lot of metrics showing up at the moment and it doesn't seem to work with all accounts but a welcome additions to the segmentation available through the actual AdWords interface! To enable this go to the usual Dimensions tab, and where you would normally segment by time you can now see Conversion options as above. And that's how you use Adwords to segment by conversion type. Naturally this will only work if you have conversions set up...
