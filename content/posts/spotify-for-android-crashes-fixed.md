Finally, after months of waiting and an endless stream of complaints from users all over the world, Spotify have updated their Android app and fixed the issues with crashing open opening, crashing when syncing and crashing a few seconds into playing. All these, as you'd expect, lead to a pretty poor experience and one that left me feeling a bit ripped off. However, the latest update has a revamped UI that fits nicely with ICS, includes extra features and also DOESN'T CRASH. That's right, Spotify doesn't crash any more. Hurrah. Thanks to the Spotify devs for fixing it!
