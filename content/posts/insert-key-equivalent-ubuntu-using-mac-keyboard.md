Pretty niche audience for this one, but posting it for my own benefit as much as anything. Thanks to the original link at [Ubuntu Forums](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=865727&s=6495873d3c823423b7008fb91d00f9c1&p=8975769#post8975769) for the following hints:

    [fn] + [return] = Insert
    [fn] + [UPARROW] = Pg Up 
    [fn] + [DOWNARROW]= Pg Down
